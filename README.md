NASSP time calculator is a small script that I made to help myself calculate times during NASSP missions. I'm not great in math and I struggled doing mission time to decimal time conversion for the AGS and time differences calculations to power up the LGC. From now on I will use this .exe while flying missions and correct bugs if I encounter them.
